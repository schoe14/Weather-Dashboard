# Weather-Dashboard
:partly_sunny: A weather application provides you with the current weather forecast for the city or cities of your choice. By default, you see a five-day forecast at the bottom of the screen with the current forecast above.

# Motivation
:sun_with_face: Accurate weather predictions are important for planning our day-to-day activities. :tractor: Farmers need information to help them plan for the planting and harvesting of their crops. :airplane: Airlines need to know about local weather conditions in order to schedule flights.
